##Foreword

The OpenID Foundation (OIDF) promotes, protects and nurtures the OpenID community and technologies. As a non-profit international standardizing body, it is comprised by over 160 participating entities (workgroup participants). The work of preparing implementer drafts and final international standards is carried out through OIDF workgroups in accordance with the OpenID Process. Participants interested in a subject for which a workgroup has been established has the right to be represented in that workgroup. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with OIDF, also take part in the work. OIDF collaborates closely with other standardizing bodies in the related fields.

Final drafts adopted by the Workgroup through consensus are circulated publicly for the public review for 60 days and for the OIDF members for voting. Publication as an OIDF Standard requires approval by at least 50 % of the members casting a vote. There is a possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject to patent rights. OIDF shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.

Financial-grade API consists of the following parts:

* Part 1: Read-Only API Security Profile
* Part 2: Read and Write API Security Profile
* Financial-grade API: Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication Profile
* Financial-grade API: JWT Secured Authorization Response Mode for OAuth 2.0 (JARM)
* Financial-grade API: Pushed Request Object
* Financial-grade API: HTTP Signing Requirements

Future parts may follow.

This part is intended to provide practical guidance on the methods that can be used for HTTP request/response signing in Financial-grade APIs.

##Introduction

The Financial-grade API Standard provides a profile for OAuth 2.0 suitable for use in financial services and other similar higher risk scenarios. Ecosystems that have Financial-grade APIs often also have a requirement for the signing of HTTP requests or responses, this document covers the likely requirements and potential solutions.

# **Financial-grade API: HTTP Signing Requirements**

[TOC]

## 1. Scope

This document specifies the method for an application to:

* obtain OAuth tokens via a backchannel authentication flow in an appropriately secure manner for financial data access and other similar situations where the risk is higher;
* use tokens to interact with protected data via REST endpoints.

## 5 Typical requirements

### 5.1 Introduction 

The section lists the likely requirements that influence the choice of HTTP signing method for ecosystems using Financial-grade APIs.

#### 5.1.1 Non-repudiation

Generally ecosystems look to signing as a method for non-repudiation, meaning that the request or response can be retained by the parties and later used as prove that the message came from a party that had possession of the relevant private key.

Although TLS certificates can be used for instantaneous proof of key possesion, it is essentially impractical to retain all the necessary state such that it is possible to later independently verify key possession.

Any signing scheme must support straightforward serialization for later verification.

#### 5.1.2 JSON payloads

As the primary use-case for Financial-grade APIs is with JSON payloads, it is generally possible to make using of signing methods that are specific to JSON.

#### 5.1.3 Interference with payload

As Financial-grade APIs always use end-to-end encrypted TLS, it is generally possible to assume that the message body will not be tampered with (deliberately or accidentally) during transport.

However many middleware systems come with REST clients that will often parse JSON payloads automatically, making it difficult to reconstruct the original message body to verify the signature. It is often possible to workaround this (for example canonicalisation or base64 encoding of payloads), but the workarounds can reduce simplicity or robustness. It is often possible to access the raw payload by avoiding use of the REST client. In time this would be less of an issue, as the hope is that REST clients would implement support for widely used signature schemes.

#### 5.1.4 Signing of entire message

In REST-like systems, the Request-URI, method and some HTTP headers often include important information that must be within the scope of the signature.

#### 5.1.5 Interoperability

HTTP signing methods must be sufficiently well specified and straightforward to implement such that the signing library does not need to be aware of ecosystem specifics.

Systems must not have high rates of false negatives between difference implementations.
