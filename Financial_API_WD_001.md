Financial API consists of the following parts, under the general title Financial Services — Financial API:

* Part 1: Read Only API Security Profile
* Part 2: Read and Write API Security Profile
* Part 3: Open Data API
* Part 4: Protected Data API and Schema - Read only
* Part 5: Protected Data API and Schema - Read and Write

This part is intended to be used with [RFC6749], [RFC6750], [RFC6736], and [OIDC].

##Introduction

In many cases, Fintech services such as aggregation services use screen scraping and store user passwords. This model is both brittle and insecure. To cope with the brittleness, it should utilize an API model with structured data and to cope with insecurity, it should utilize a token model such as OAuth [RFC6749, RFC6750].

Financial API aims to rectify the situation by developing a REST/JSON model protected by OAuth. 
However, just asking to use OAuth is too vague as there are many implementation choices. 
OAuth is a framework which can cover wide range of use-cases thus some implementation choices are easy to implement but less secure 
and some implementation choices are harder to implement but more secure. 
Financial services on the internet is a use-case that requires more secure implementation choices. 
That is, OAuth needs to be profiled to be used in the financial use-cases. 

This document is a Part 1 of a set of document that specifies Financial API. 
It provides a profile of OAuth that is suitable to be used in the access of Read Only financial data. 
An even more secure profile that is suitable for a transactional (i.e., Read/Write) APIs are given in Part 2. 
Part 3 onwards provides the data schema for specific use-cases.

## 5. Read Only API Security Profile

### 5.1 Introduction

The OIDF Financial API (FAPI) is a REST API that provides JSON data representing accounts and transactions related data. These APIs are protected by the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework that consists of [RFC6749], [RFC6750], [RFC7636], and other specifications.

These API accesses have several levels of risks associated to them. Read only access is generally speaking associated with lower financial risk than the write access. As such, the characteristics required to the tokens are also different.

In the following subclauses, the method to obtain tokens are explained separately.


### 5.2 Read Only API Security Provisions

#### 5.2.1 Introduction

Read Only Access typically is the lower risk scenario compared to the Write access, so the protection level can also be lower.
However, since the FAPI would provide potentially sensitive information, it requires more protection level than a basic [RFC6749] requires.


As a profile of The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework, this document mandates the following to the Read Only API of the FAPI.

#### 5.2.2 Authorization Server

The Authorization Server

* shall support both public and confidential clients;
* shall provide a client secret that adheres to the requirements in section 16.19 of [OIDC] if a symmetric key is used;
* shall authenticate the confidential client at the Token Endpoint using one of the following methods:
    1. TLS mutual authentication [TLSM]; 
    2. JWS Client Assertion using the `client_secret` or a private key as specified in section 9 of [OIDC]; 
* shall require a key of size 2048 bits or larger if RSA algorithms are used for the client authentication;
* shall require a key of size 160 bits or larger if elliptic curve algorithms are used for the client authentication;
* shall support [RFC7636] with `S256` as the code challenge method;
* shall require Redirect URIs to be pre-registered;
* shall require the `redirect_uri` parameter in the authorization request;
* shall require the value of `redirect_uri` to exactly match one of the pre-registered Redirect URIs;
* shall require user authentication at LoA 2 as defined in [X.1254] or more;
* shall require explicit consent by the user to authorize the requested scope if it has not been previously authorized;
* shall verify that the Authorization Code has not been previously used if possible;
* shall return the token response as defined in 4.1.4 of [RFC6749]; 
* shall return the list of allowed scopes with the issued access token;  
* shall provide opaque non-guessable access tokens with a minimum of 128 bits as defined in section 5.1.4.2.2 of [RFC6819]. 
* should clearly identify long-term grants to the user during authorization as in 16.18 of [OIDC]; and 
* should provide a mechanism for the end-user to revoke access tokens and refresh tokens granted to a Client as in 16.18 of [OIDC].

    **NOTE**: The Financial API server may limit the scopes for the purpose of not implementing certain APIs.

    **NOTE**: Section 4.1.3 of [RFC6749] does not say anything about the `code` reuse, but this document is putting limitation on it as per Section 3.1.3.2 of [OIDC].

    **NOTE**: If replay identification of the authorization code is not possible, it is desirable to set the validity period of the authorization code to one minute or a suitable short period of time. The validity period may act as a cache control indicator of when to clear the authorization code cache if one is used.

    **NOTE**: The opaqueness requirement for the access token does not preclude the server to create a structured access token. 
	
Further, if it wishes to provide the authenticated user's identifier to the client in the token response, the authorization server

* shall support the authentication request as in Section 3.1.2.1 of [OIDC];
* shall perform the authentication request verification as in Section 3.1.2.2 of [OIDC];
* shall authenticate the user as in Section 3.1.2.2 and 3.1.2.3 of [OIDC];
* shall provide the authentication response as in Section 3.1.2.4 and 3.1.2.5 of [OIDC] depending on the outcome of the authentication;
* shall perform the token request verification as in Section 3.1.3.2 of [OIDC]; and
* shall issue an ID Token in the token response when `openid` was included in the requested `scope`
  as in Section 3.1.3.3 of [OIDC] with its `sub` value corresponding to the authenticated user
  and optional `acr` value in ID Token.

#### 5.2.3 Public Client

A Public Client

* shall support [RFC7636] or the mechanisms defined in [Financial API - Part 2](Financial_API_WD_002.md);
* shall use `S256` as the code challenge method for the [RFC7636];
* shall use separate and distinct Redirect URI for each Authorization Server that it talks to;
* shall store the Redirect URI value in the resource owner's user-agents (such as browser) session and compare it with the Redirect URI that the Authorization Response was received at, where, if the URIs do not match, the Client shall terminate the process with error;
* shall adhere to the best practice stated by [O2fNA]; and
* shall implement an effective CSRF protection.

Further, if it wishes to obtain a persistent identifier of the authenticated user, it

* shall include `openid` in the `scope` value; and
* shall include `nonce` parameter defined in Section 3.1.2.1 of [OIDC] in the authentication request.

    **NOTE**: Adherence to [RFC7636] means that the token request includes `code_verifier` parameter in the request.


#### 5.2.4 Confidential Client

In addition to the provision to the Public Client, the Confidential Client

* shall support the following methods to authenticate against the Token Endpoint:
    1. TLS mutual authentication [TLSM]; or 
    2. JWS Client Assertion using the `client_secret` or a private key as specified in section 9 of [OIDC]; 
* shall use RSA keys with a minimum 2048 bits if using RSA cryptography; 
* shall use Elliptic Curve keys with a minimum of 160 bits if using Elliptic Curve cryptography; and 
* shall verify that its client secret has a minimum of 128 bits if using symmetric key cryptography.


## 6. Accessing Protected Resources

### 6.1 Introduction

The FAPI endpoints are OAuth 2.0 protected resource endpoints that return financial information for the resource owner associated with the submitted access token.

### 6.2 Read only access provisions

#### 6.2.1 Protected resources provisions

The resource server with the FAPI endpoints

* shall mandate TLS 1.2 or later as defined in [RFC5246] with the usage following the best practice in [RFC7525];
* shall support the use of the HTTP GET method defined in [RFC2616];
* shall accept access tokens in the HTTP header as in Section 2.1 of OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage [RFC6750];
* shall not accept access tokens in the query parameters stated in Section 2.3 of OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage [RFC6750];
* shall verify that the access token is not expired nor revoked;
* shall verify that the scope associated with the access token authorizes the reading of the resource it is representing;
* shall identify the associated user to the access token;
* shall only return the resource identified by the combination of the user implicit in the access and the granted scope and otherwise return errors as in section 3.1 of [RFC6750];
* shall encode the response in UTF-8; 
* shall send the `Content-type` HTTP header `Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8`;
* shall send the server date in HTTP date header as in section 14.18 of [RFC2616];
* shall set the response header `x-fapi-interaction-id` to the value received from the corresponding fapi client request header or to a [RFC4122] UUID value if the request header was not provided to track the interaction, e.g., `x-fapi-interaction-id: c770aef3-6784-41f7-8e0e-ff5f97bddb3a`; and
* shall log the value of `x-fapi-interaction-id` in the log entry.


    **NOTE**: While this document does not specify the exact method to find out the user associated with the
    access token and the granted scope, the protected resource can use OAuth Token Introspection [RFC7662].

Further, it

* should support the use of Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) [CORS] and or other methods as appropriate to enable Java Script Clients to access the endpoint if it decides to provide access to Javascript clients.

    **NOTE**: Providing access to Javascript clients has other security implications. Before supporting those clients [RFC6819] should be consulted.

#### 6.2.2 Client provisions

The client supporting this document

* shall use TLS 1.2 or later as defined in [RFC5246] with the usage following the best practice in [RFC7525];
* shall send access tokens in the HTTP header as in Section 2.1 of OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage [RFC6750]; and 
* shall send `x-fapi-financial-id` whose value is the unique identifier of the desired financial institution to interact assigned by the service bureau where the API is provided by a service bureau which uses the same endpoint for multiple institutions.

    **NOTE**: Conceptually, the value of the `x-fapi-financial-id` corresponds to `iss` in the ID Token
    but is not required to be an https URI. It often is the routing number of the FI.

Further, the client

* can optionally supply the last time the customer logged into the client in the `x-fapi-customer-last-logged-time` header where the value is supplied as ** w3c date **, e.g., `x-fapi-customer-last-logged-time: Tue, 11 Sep 2012 19:43:31 UTC`; and
* can supply the customer’s IP address if this data is available or applicable in the `x-fapi-customer-ip-address` header, e.g., `x-fapi-customer-ip-address: 198.51.100.119`; and
* may send the `x-fapi-interaction-id` request header whose value is a [RFC4122] UUID to the server to help correlate log entries between client
and server, e.g., `x-fapi-interaction-id: c770aef3-6784-41f7-8e0e-ff5f97bddb3a`.





## 7. Security Considerations

### 7.1 TLS Considerations

Since confidential information is being exchanged, all interactions shall be encrypted with TLS/SSL (HTTPS) in accordance with the recommendations in [RFC7525]. TLS version 1.2 or later shall be used for all communications.

### 7.2 Message source authentication failure

Authorization request and response are not authenticated. 
For a higher risk scenarios, it should be taken care of. 
See Part 2, which uses request object to achieve the message source authentication. 

### 7.3 Message integrity protection failure

Authorization request is not message integrity protected thus 
request tampering and parameter injection are possible. 
Where the protection is desired, it should use Part 2. 

The response is integrity protected when ID Token is returned 
from the authorization endpoint. 

### 7.4 Message containment failure

#### 7.4.1 Authorization request and response

In this document, the authorization request is not encrypted. 
Thus, it is possible to leak the information contained 
if the browser was infected with virus, etc. 

Authorization response can be encrypted as ID Token 
can be encrypted. 

It is possible to leak the information through the logs 
if the parameters were recorded in the logs and 
the access to the logs are compromised. 
Strict access control to the logs in such cases should be 
enforced. 

#### 7.4.2 Token request and response

It is possible to leak the information through the logs 
if the parameters were recorded in the logs and 
the access to the logs are compromised. 
Strict access control to the logs in such cases should be 
enforced. 

#### 7.4.3 Resource request and response

Care should be taken so that the sensitive data will not be leaked 
through the referrer. 

If the access token is a bearer token, it is possible to 
exercise the stolen token. Since the access token can be 
used against multiple URIs, the risk of its leaking is
much larger than the refresh token, which is used only 
against the token endpoint. Thus, the lifetime of 
the access token should be much shorter than that of 
the refresh token. Refer to section 16.18 of [OIDC] for 
more discussion on the lifetimes of access tokens and 
refresh tokens. 

## 8. Privacy Considerations

    ** NOTE ** The following only has a boiler plate text 
    specifying the general principles. More specific text 
    will be added towards the Final specification. 

### 8.1 Privacy by design

* Privacy impact analysis (PIA) should be performed in the initial phase of the system planning.
* For PIA, use of ISO/IEC 29134 Privacy impact analysis - Guidelines is recommended.
* The provider should establish a management system to help respect privacy of the customer.

### 8.2 Adhering to privacy principles

Stakeholders should follow the privacy principles of ISO/IEC 29100. In particular:

1. Consent and Choice
2. Purpose legitimacy and specification
3. Collection limitation
4. Data (access) limitation
5. Use, retention, and data disclosure limitation:
    1. Use limitation:
    1. Retention limitation: Where the data is no longer being used, clients should delete such data from their system within 180 days except for the cases it needs to retain due to the legal restrictions;
    1. Data disclosure limitation:
6. Accuracy and quality
7. Openness, transparency and notice
8. Individual participation and access
9. Accountability
10. Information security
11. Privacy compliance
