##Introduction

Fintech is an area of future economic growth around the world and Fintech organizations need to improve the security of their operations and protect customer data. It is common practice of aggregation services to use screen scraping as a method to capture data by storing users' passwords. This brittle, inefficient, and insecure practice creates security vulnerabilities which require financial institutions to allow what appears to be an automated attack against their applications and to maintain a whitelist of aggregators. A new draft standard, proposed by this workgroup would instead utilize an API model with structured data and a token model, such as OAuth [RFC6749, RFC6750].

The Financial-grade API aims to provide specific implementation guidelines for online financial services to adopt by developing a REST/JSON data model protected by a highly secured OAuth profile.
 
This document defines a new mode for handling request objects called "pushed request objects" that allows the client to create the request object at the authorization server. This relieves the client from the burden to maintain request objects and facilitates the stability of the authorization process as the authorization server does not need to call back to the client in order to obtain the authorization request data. 

Due to the use of TLS and the aibility to directly authenticate the client over the TLS connection, this mechanism can support both signed and unsigned JWTs.

## 4. Introduction

OpenID Connect and OAuth already support the transfer of authorization request parameters in JSON format in two ways:

* the `request` parameter may carry the request data in a JWT
* the `request_uri` parameter carries a URI referring to a place where the AS may retrieve the request object. 

Both mechanisms contribute to the security of the request by allowing for the signing and encryption of the authorization request data.

The request URI additionally allows the client to just send the URI value in the authorization request as a pointer to the request object, rather than the full content of the request object itself, which allows for the transfer of larger amounts of request data without issues caused by URI length restrictions. 

However, the request URI mechanisms also has some downsides. Neither [JAR] nor [OIDC] specify a mechanism to let the client lodge the request object at a trusted service, such as the AS, before sending the authorization request. The client therefore either needs to use a non-standard mechanism for request object management or it is required to maintain and expose request objects itself. 

This might look easy on first sight, but the client needs to be able to handle inbound requests from the authorization server and, potentially, store a large number of objects in its database including the need to properly clean them up. It also means the availability and latency of the authorization process at the authorization server depends on the availability and latency of the client’s backend. Moreover, in order to dereference the `request_uri` parameter the authorization has to make outbound HTTP requests, which brings with it all the potential problems of server-side request forgery.

This specification addresses these problems by defining an OAuth extension that allows the client to lodge request objects at the authorization server. The authorization server offers an additional "request object endpoint". The client calls this endpoint to deliver its request objects and is provided with a unique URI for that particular request object, which in turn is sent into to the AS's authorization endpoint as the value of the `request_uri` parameter.  

This draft allows the client to send the request object via a direct POST request to the AS rather than as a redirect URI query parameter. 

## 5. Request Object Endpoint
This section describes the process of request object creation and its use in the authorization request.

### 5.1 Request Object Request

The request object endpoint shall be a RESTful API at the authorization server that accepts `x-www-form-urlencoded` POST. 

The rules for client authentication as defined in [RFC6749] for token endpoint requests 
apply for the request object endpoint as well. 

Confidential clients are required to authenticate towards the request object endpoint using the authentication method registered for their `client_id`. If applicable, the `token_endpoint_auth_method` client metadata parameter indicates the registered authentication method for the client to use when making direct requests to the authorization server, including requests to the token endpoint and the request object endpoint (and others). Applicable token endpoint authentication methods are registered in the IANA "OAuth Token Endpoint Authentication Methods" registry [IANA.OAuth.Parameters] defined by [RFC7591].

Note that there's some potential ambiguity around the appropriate audience 
value to use when JWT client assertion based authentication is employed. To address that ambiguity the issuer URL of the AS according to [RFC8414] MUST be used as the value of the audience. 

The request object is sent in the parameter `request` as defined in [JAR].

The rules for signing and encryption of the request object as defined in [JAR] apply.  

The following is an example of a request using a signed request object. The client is 
authenticated using its client secret `BASIC` authorization:

```
POST https://as.example.com/ros/ HTTP/1.1
Host: as.example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0Mzo3RmpmcDBaQnIxS3REUmJuZlZkbUl3

```

Since the communication is HTTPS-protected, clients may decide to send an 
unsigned JWT (using the JWS algorithm `none`) as the request object. This 
generally simplifies use of the request object pattern in cases where 
the additional security properties of the application level signature are 
not needed. It also allows public clients to protect the authorization request 
from modifications without the need to establish a secret with the AS.

The following is an example of a public client sending a unsigned request object to the AS:

```
POST https://as.example.com/ros/ HTTP/1.1
Host: as.example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

request=eyJhbGciOiJub25lIn0.eyJpc3MiOiJzNkJoZFJrcXQzIiwiYXVkIjoi

```

### 5.2 Sucessful Response

The AS MUST process the request as follows:

1. If the client is a confidential client, the AS first authenticates the client.  
1. If applicable, the AS decrypts the request object (if applicable) as specified in [JAR], section 6.1.
1. If applicable, the AS validates the request object signature as specified in [JAR], section 6.2.
1. If the client is a confidential client, the authorization server MUST check whether the authenticated `client_id` matches the `client_id` and, if present, the `iss` claim in the request objects. If they do not match, the authorization server MUST refuse to process the request. 
1. In the next step, the authorization server verifies whether the parameters sent are 
valid as specified in [JAR], section 6.3. For example, the authorization server checks, whether the redirect URI matches one of the redirect URIs configured for the server. It may also check whether the client is authorized for the scope for which it requested access. This validation allows the authorization server to refuse unauthorized or fraudulent requests early.  
1. If the verification is successful, the server shall generate a request URI and return a JSON payload that contains `request_uri` and `expires_in` claims at the top level with `201 Created` HTTP response code.
1. The `request_uri` value shall be generated using a cryptographically strong pseudorandom algorithm such that it is computationally infeasible to predict or guess a valid value.   
1. The request URI shall be bound to the client identifier of the client that posted the request object.
1. Since the request URI can be replayed, its lifetime should be short and preferably limited to one-time use.
1. The value of these claims in the JSON payload shall be as follows:
    * `request_uri` : The request URI corresponding to the request object posted. This URI is used as reference to the respective request object in subsequent authorization requests only. The way the authorization process obtains the request object data is at the discretion of the authorization server and out of scope of this specification. There is no need to make the request object data available to other parties via this URI.
    * `expires_in` : A JSON number that represents the lifetime of the request URI in seconds. The request URI lifetime is at the discretion of the AS. There is no dependency defined by this draft between the value of `expires_in` and an `exp` claim that might be contained in the respective request object. 

The following is an example of such a response:

```
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Date: Tue, 2 May 2017 15:22:31 GMT
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "request_uri": "urn:example:GkurKxf5T0Y-mnPFCHqWOMiZi4VS138cQO_V7PZHAdM",
    "expires_in": 3600
}
``` 

### 5.3 Error responses

#### 5.3.1 Authentication required
If the signature validation or client authentication fails, the authorization server shall return `401 Unauthorized` HTTP error response.

#### 5.3.2 Authorization required
If the client is not authorized to perform the authorization request it wanted to post, the authorization server shall return `403 Forbidden` HTTP error response.

#### 5.3.3 Invalid request
If the request object received is invalid, the authorization server shall return `400 Bad Request` HTTP error response.

#### 5.3.4 Method not allowed
If the request did not use POST, the authorization server shall return `405 Method Not Allowed` HTTP error response.

#### 5.3.5 Payload Too Large
If the request size was beyond the upper bound that the authorization server allows, the authorization server shall return a `413 Payload Too Large` HTTP error response as defined in [RFC7231].

#### 5.3.6 Too many requests
If the request from the client per a time period goes beyond the number the authorization server allows, the authorization server shall return a `429 Too Many Requests` HTTP error response.

### 5.4 Authorization Request

The client uses the `request_uri` value as returned by the authorization server as authorization request parameter `request_uri`.

```
https://server.example.com/authorize?request_uri=urn:example:MTAyODAK
```
Note: we should encourage clients to use the request URI as the only parameter in order to use the integrity and authenticity provided by the pushed request object.

## 6. Authorization Server Metadata

If the authorization server has a request object endpoint, it shall include the following OAuth/OpenID Provider Metadata parameter in discovery responses:

1. `request_object_endpoint` : The url of the request object endpoint at which the client can exchange a request object for a request URI.

## 7. Security considerations

### 7.1. Request URI Guessing
An attacker could attempt to guess and replay a valid request URI value and 
try to impersonat the respective client. The AS MUST consider the considerations
given in [JAR], section 10.2, clause d on request URI entropy.

### 7.2 Request Object Replay
An attacker could replay a request URI captured from a legit authorization request.
In order to cope with such attacks, the AS SHOULD make the request URIs one-time use.

### 7.3 Client Policy Change
The client policy might change between the lodging of the request object and the 
authorization request using a particular request object. It is therefore recommended 
that the AS checks the request parameter against the client policy when processing 
the authorization request.

## 8. Privacy considerations
