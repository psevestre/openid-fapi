# FAPI-R Security Profile Comparison

The following provides a clause by clause breakdown comparing [Financial-grade API - Part 1: Read-Only API Security Profile](https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1.html) to the published [Consumer Data Standards v1.1.1](https://consumerdatastandardsaustralia.github.io/standards).

|  **https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1.html** | **CDS Guidance** | **Modifies Upstream Standard** | **Summary** |

Protected resources provisions](https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1.html#protected-resources-provisions) | Yes | Yes :octagonal_sign: | The following alterations to this clause are made within the [CDS Headers](https://consumerdatastandardsaustralia.github.io/standards/#http-headers) specification: |
| | | | - *Item 9:* Standards specify an explicit charset of `application/json` which is not aligned. *NOTE: This clause in FAPI is scheduled to alter to be aligned to CDS*  |
| | | | - *Item 10*: Standards **DO NOT** require the HTTP Date header |
| | | | - *Item 13*: CORS headers are specified for Unauthenticated Endpoints |
